<p style="text-align:justify;">In this study, we will ask you to read very short sentences and rate their plausibility. You will rate each sentence on a scale from <b>1 (very implausible)</b> to <b>7 (very plausible)</b>. 
</p>

 
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you think that the sentence makes sense (high plausibility), give it a high rating; if you think the sentence does not make sense (low plausibility), give it a low rating. There will also be cases where you want to give an intermediate rating (when the sentence is somewhat plausible). Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The sentence "He washed the car." would receive a high rating of 6 or 7 because it describes a plausible event.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify;">A sentence such as "She baked the ocean." would receive a very low rating of 1 or 2, because the event is entirely implausible and in this case also describes a situation that is impossible in the real world. </p> 

<p style="text-align:justify;">An intermediate rating of 3, 4, or 5 indicates that the sentence is not completely unlikely, but that the situation described is not (the most) natural such as "He presented the door."</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some items may seem easier to rate than others, but try to go with your first intuition. Take advantage of the full scale and select the rating that best reflects your own feeling about the sentence.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We will start with a few practice items so that you can get used to the rating scale. You can indicate your rating by using the mouse or by entering a number on your keyboard.</p>
