<h1 style="font-size:28px;"><b>Welcome to our sentence rating experiment!</b></h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Thank you for participating in this study for the University of Potsdam Linguistics department. We greatly appreciate your participation; it provides valuable data for scientific research on language comprehension.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;">This study is restricted to native speakers of English. If your native language (i.e. the language you learned from birth) is not English, we kindly ask that you do not participate in this study. If you grew up with English and one or more other languages, you may participate if English was the dominant language used in the home (age 2-5) and if English was the dominant language in nursery (if applicable) and in formal education settings.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">You must be at least 18 years of age to participate. You will receive an experiment code with instructions for payment after you have completed the study. Please note: You can only participate once in this study for payment. 
  Multiple submissions from a single user are not eligible for payment.
</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible to use a mobile phone or a tablet for this task. Before you start, please turn off the sound on your electronic devices and use the full screen mode for this experiment. This study will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. </p>
